# pyck_project

Motivation:
In recent times of pandemic it is difficult to monitor social distancing of people. So we can set a threshold of people in most active zones and send warnings appropriately. It can also be used to open or close  gates to a place depending on the density of the people in that area..

Object detection is one of the classical problems in computer vision where you work to recognize what and where — specifically what objects are inside a given image and also where they
are in the image. The problem of object detection is more complex than classification, which
also can recognize objects but doesn’t indicate where the object is located in the image. In
addition, classification doesn’t work on images containing more than one object.

You can run this project using normal commands python3 manage.py runserver.
but you require model.h5 file in files folder,which can be got by running project.ipynb file present in the file folder.
As it is computationaly hard to run neuralnet in laptop. run .ipynb file in google collab to get model.h5 file
In the web site you can navigate between upload files and upload video paths to upload files and vdos respectively.
